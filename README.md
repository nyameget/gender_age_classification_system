Introduction
This project aims to create a web application that can predict the gender and age of a person from an uploaded image. The system leverages machine learning models and provides an easy-to-use web interface for users.

Features
Gender Detection: Predicts whether the person in the image is male or female.
Age Detection: Estimates the age of the person in the image.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface.
Real-Time Processing: Fast and efficient image processing.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Flask
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge
Virtual environment tools (optional but recommended)
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code

cd gender-age-detection
Set Up the Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Application
bash
